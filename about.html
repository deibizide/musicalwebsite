                    <div class="bio">
                        <p>Growing up on the Island of Mallorca (Spain), David was musical from an early age, sitting on his father's knees, in front of the drum kit and hitting hard on the cymbals was his first contact with music in general.
                            David was raised between the record store and the Rock & Roll club of his father where he has his first experiences with music. At the age of 8 started to play the acoustic guitar and he was just amazed by the sound and felt in love directly with the instrument.</p>
                        <p>During his teenage he moved to Stockholm (Sweden) and started playing Guitar with the School Band and formed different bands with his brother, strongly influenced by the Swedish Death Metal sound. Years later David moved back to Mallorca and formed the band The Ox, they released their debut album Obsidian in 2013, receiving critical acclaim from across the music scene in Spain. David felt that being on an Island like Mallorca could stop him of achieving higher goals, therefore in 2014 he moved to Berlin (Germany) where he spent 2 years learning music from different teachers like Damian Murdoch or Ed Richwood, during this period he built up strong foundation on his instrument.</p>
                        <p>In late 2017/early 2018, David teamed up with the German progressive metal group The Ocean. He has toured throughout Germany  and Europe, with performances at Dunk! Festival or Leeds Damnation Festival. The band has already put together an epic two-album, Phanerozoic I: Palaeozoic
                             The central idea of the album is about  ‘the eternal recurrence', "Nietzsche's concept that everything happens over and over again, an infinite amount of times throughout infinite time and space”.</p>
                         <p>David will be touring the world  so make sure to keep an eye on social media for updates.</p>
