                    <div class="bio">
                        <p>David has received critical acclaim from across the acoustic guitar world for his debut album ‘Reborn’ (co-produced by Chris Woods Groove), folk-fingerstyle album 'Set Adrift' with Daryl Kellie and three EPs ‘Defuse’, ‘Sticks & Stones’ and ‘Momento’ (the latter produced by Declan Zapala). He has toured throughout the UK (recently with Maneli Jamal) and Europe, with performances at Isle of Wight Festival, London Acoustic Guitar Show, The Turner Sims Concert Hall, and Ullapool Guitar Festival where he co-headlined with fingerstyle legend Preston Reed.</p>
                        <p>Growing up on the Isle of Mallorca, David was musical from an early age, sitting on his father's knees in front of the drum kit and hitting hard on the cymbals was his first contact with music in general.
                             Before he found his acoustic calling, he fronted many bands, touring America with hard rock band Zhain and supporting Orbital and Gin Wigmore with Drum n Bass Rock outfit Opinaut. After equipping himself with a National Diploma at Platform One and a BA Hons in Music from Southampton University, he has now built up strong foundations in Surrey with multi-award-winning functions, in-demand guitar tuition and highly recommended session work. </p>
                        <p>In late 2017/early 2018, David teamed up with the band The Ocean ingerstyle guitarist Daryl Kellie and put together a unique collaboration album ‘Set Adrift’, which was inspired by a short musical tour on a narrow boat along the River Thames. This five-day journey resulted in a ten- track album drawing influences from fingerstyle, folk and jazz. The guys toured the album around the UK back in spring. In late 2017 Jon toured the UK with fingerstyle guitarist Maneli Jamal in collaboration with Cole Clark Guitars UK. 2018/19 will be the build-up to Jon's next release and touring so be sure to keep an eye on social media for updates. </p>
